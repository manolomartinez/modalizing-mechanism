Modalizing Mechanisms
=====================

The NetLogo model discussed in my paper *Modalizing Mechanisms*. 


# Usage

Put `modalizing-mechanisms.nlogo` and `utils.nls` in the same directory and
open `modalizing-mechanisms.nlogo` with
[NetLogo](http://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) Any 5.x version should work.

Please refer to the info tab of the model and to the related paper for
explanation of what it attempts to show.
